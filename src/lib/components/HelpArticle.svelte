		<h2 id="rendering-options-grid">Rendering options: Grid</h2>

		<h3>Which grid type should I choose?</h3>
		<p>The app provides different grid types for you to use:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p><strong>Full grid</strong></p>
				<p>
					Use this if you want the grid to have both the outer border and the inner grid lines
					between the cells as shown below.
				</p>
				<div class="grid place-items-start">
					<div class="bg-base-content grid grid-cols-3 grid-rows-3 gap-[1px] p-[1px]">
						{#each { length: 9 }}
							<div class="bg-base-100 size-8"></div>
						{/each}
					</div>
				</div>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><strong>Grid lines only</strong></p>
				<p>
					Use this if you want only the inner grid lines between the cells without the outer grid
					border as shown below.
				</p>
				<div class="grid place-items-start">
					<div class="bg-base-content grid grid-cols-3 grid-rows-3 gap-[1px]">
						{#each { length: 9 }}
							<div class="bg-base-100 size-8"></div>
						{/each}
					</div>
				</div>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><strong>Outer border only</strong></p>
				<p>
					Use this if you want only the outer grid border without the inner grid lines as shown
					below.
				</p>
				<div class="grid place-items-start">
					<div class="bg-base-content grid grid-cols-3 grid-rows-3 p-[1px]">
						{#each { length: 9 }}
							<div class="bg-base-100 size-8"></div>
						{/each}
					</div>
				</div>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><strong>None</strong></p>
				<p>
					Use this if you do not want any type of grid lines. This can be useful when you only want
					to round the corners of cells as shown below.
				</p>
				<div class="grid place-items-start">
					<div class="grid grid-cols-3 grid-rows-3 p-[1px]">
						{#each { length: 9 }}
							<div class="bg-base-content size-8 rounded-lg"></div>
						{/each}
					</div>
				</div>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>How do I change the color of the grid?</h3>
		<p>
			Click on the <strong>Grid color</strong> setting to choose a different color for the grid. The
			selected color is also used to round cell corners even if the grid type is None.
		</p>

		<h3>How do I change the grid lines size?</h3>
		<p>
			Click on the <strong>Grid lines size</strong> setting and type a value in pixels to choose how
			thin or thick you want the outer border and the inner grid lines to be.
		</p>

		<h2 id="rendering-options-grid-cells">Rendering options: Grid cells</h2>

		<h3>What are grid cells?</h3>
		<p>
			A grid divides an image into cells that are separated by grid lines. For example, in the 3x3
			grid below there are nine grid cells labelled from 1 to 9.
		</p>

		<div class="not-prose grid place-items-start">
			<div class="bg-base-content grid grid-cols-3 grid-rows-3 gap-[1px] p-[1px]">
				{#each { length: 9 }, i}
					<div class="bg-base-100 grid size-8 place-items-center">{i + 1}</div>
				{/each}
			</div>
		</div>

		<h3>How do I change the shape of grid cells?</h3>
		<p>
			Click on the <strong>Grid cell shape</strong> setting and select between
			<strong>Square</strong> to have grid cells with the same width and height (shown below on the
			left) and
			<strong>Rectangle</strong> to freely choose the grid cell sizes (shown below on the right).
		</p>

		<div class="flex items-center gap-8">
			<div class="grid place-items-start">
				<div class="bg-base-content grid grid-cols-3 grid-rows-3 gap-[1px] p-[1px]">
					{#each { length: 9 }}
						<div class="bg-base-100 size-8"></div>
					{/each}
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="grid place-items-start">
				<div class="bg-base-content grid grid-cols-3 grid-rows-3 gap-[1px] p-[1px]">
					{#each { length: 9 }}
						<div class="bg-base-100 h-8 w-16"></div>
					{/each}
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>

		<h3>How do I change the width of grid cells?</h3>
		<p>
			Click on the <strong>Grid cell width</strong> setting and type a value in pixels to choose how
			wide you want the grid cells to be. This value will also be used for the height of grid cells
			if the grid cells shape is set to <strong>Square</strong>.
		</p>

		<h3>How do I change the height of grid cells?</h3>
		<p>
			Click on the <strong>Grid cell shape</strong> setting and select the
			<strong>Rectangle</strong> option, then click on the <strong>Grid cell height</strong> setting
			and type a value in pixels to choose how tall you want the grid cells to be.
		</p>

		<h3>Are all the grid cells the exact same size?</h3>
		<p>
			All grid cells have the exact same size except for the ones that do not fit in the image at
			the right and bottom edges. Fox example, in the grid below the cells 3, 6, and 9 are smaller
			and only fill the remaining space on the right.
		</p>

		<div class="grid place-items-start">
			<div class="bg-base-content grid grid-cols-[2fr_2fr_1fr] grid-rows-3 gap-[1px] p-[1px]">
				{#each { length: 9 }, i}
					<div
						class={['bg-base-100 grid h-8 place-items-center', (i + 1) % 3 === 0 ? 'w-8' : 'w-16']}
					>
						{i + 1}
					</div>
				{/each}
			</div>
		</div>

		<h3>How do I scale up grid cells?</h3>
		<p>
			Click on the <strong>Grid cell scale</strong> setting and type a multiplier value to apply to the
			grid cell sizes. For example, if you set the scale to 5, a grid cell that is 20x20 pixels in the
			original image will be scaled up to 100x100 pixels in the rendered image.
		</p>

		<h3>How do I round the corner of grid cells?</h3>
		<p>
			Click on the <strong>Grid cell corner radius</strong> setting and type a value in pixels for the
			radius to apply to the corners of grid cells. You may need to also scale up cells if they are too
			small to be rounded correctly.
		</p>

		<h2 id="rendering-options-opacity">Rendering options: Opacity</h2>

		<h3>How do I change the transparency of pixels?</h3>
		<p>
			Click on the <strong>Transparent pixels</strong> setting and select between the
			<strong>Preserve transparency</strong> option to keep the original pixel transparency in the
			rendered image and the <strong>Fully opaque pixels</strong> option to make all pixels fully opaque
			in the rendered image.
		</p>

		<h3>Why should I make the pixels fully opaque?</h3>
		<p>
			Preserving the original pixel transparency causes the image colors to be mixed with the grid
			color. Changing the pixels to fully opaque prevents the mixing between the image colors and
			the grid color.
		</p>

		<h2 id="tips-for-pixel-art">Tips for pixel art</h2>

		<h3>Use square, 1x1 pixels grid cells</h3>
		<p>
			If you want every pixel in the original pixel art image to be its own grid cell, use the
			<strong>Square</strong> cell shape and set the <strong>cell width</strong> to be 1 pixel. These
			are the default rendering options.
		</p>

		<h3>Scale up grid cells to distinguish them from grid lines</h3>
		<p>
			If every pixel is its own grid cell and the grid lines size is also 1 pixel, the rendered
			image can look confusing. To avoid this, you can set the <strong>cell scale</strong> to 10 for
			example. This causes the grid cells to become 10x10 pixels in the rendered image while the grid
			lines remain 1 pixel thick.
		</p>

		<h3>Scale up grid cells to round their corners</h3>
		<p>
			If every pixel is its own grid cell and you want the corners to be rounded, you need to scale
			up the grid cells. For example, you can set the <strong>cell scale</strong> to 50 and the
			<strong>cell corner radius</strong> to 10. This causes the grid cells to become 50x50 pixels in
			the rendered image with a corner radius of 10 pixels.

		<h2 id="tips-for-high-resolution-images">Tips for high resolution images</h2>

		<h3>Use larger grid cells</h3>
		<p>
			If you are adding a grid to a high resolution image, try setting the
			<strong>cell width</strong> to a higher value like 100 pixels. Otherwise, the grid will be very
			fine and the rendered image will look like a darker version of the original image.
		</p>

		<h3>Use thicker grid lines</h3>
		<p>
			If you are using larger cell sizes, you may also need to increase the
			<strong>grid lines size</strong> to better see the grid lines in the rendered images.
		</p>

		<h3>Render fewer images at a time</h3>
		<p>
			Adding grids to high resolution images, especially with smaller cell sizes, is a resource
			intensive operation which may cause the app to become slow and unresponsive. If you are
			rendering many high resolution images, try rendering them in smaller batches or one by one.
		</p>

		<h2 id="other-questions">Other questions</h2>

		<h3>Are the original colors exactly preserved in the rendered images?</h3>
		<p>
			<strong>Probably not.</strong> Depending on the browser that you are using, you should expect some
			slight differences between the colors in a rendered image and the original image colors. In general,
			rendering images should be considered a lossy operation.
		</p>

		<h3>Why is the app becoming slow and unresponsive?</h3>
		<p>
			The app performance is influenced by your browser and device. If you are rendering a high
			number of images or even a single high quality image, you should expect some slowdowns.
